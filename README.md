# Splat Pictogram in Flutter

A starter Flutter project template: organized, ready for customization, and set up to prepare "splat pictogram" assets (or similar purposes).

---

## Project Overview

`splat_pictogram_prep` is a well-structured foundation for Flutter development, featuring:
- Default folder structure including `android/`, `ios/`, `lib/`, `test/`, and `assets/images/`
- Standard configuration files like `.gitignore`, `pubspec.yaml`, `analysis_options.yaml`, etc.
- A blank README with basic Flutter Getting Started info—ripe for expansion

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have installed:
- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)  
- A code editor such as [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)  
- A connected device or emulator (Android/iOS)

### Setup & Run

```
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/shakiz/splat_pictogram_prep.git
cd splat_pictogram_prep

# Install dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
```

## Usage
Add pictogram assets (e.g. .png, .svg) into assets/images/.
Reference them in pubspec.yaml:
```
flutter:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
```

Use in code:
```
Image.asset('assets/images/your_pictogram.png');
```
Build UI around the prepared pictograms—perfect for icon collections, interactive displays, or visual utilities.

Assets
```
Place image/pictogram files in assets/images/.
```
Ensure that pubspec.yaml includes them under the flutter → assets section so they’re bundled.
